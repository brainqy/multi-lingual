# Project Roadmap: JobMatch AI

This document provides a high-level overview of the strategic direction for the JobMatch AI platform, combining technical enhancements, feature development, and testing strategies.

---

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Functionality & Testing Foundation (Complete)

This phase focused on building and validating the essential features of the application.

*   **Core Features:** Implemented all primary user stories, including authentication, job tracking, community feed, alumni connections, and basic AI integrations (Resume Analyzer, Mock Interview).
*   **Comprehensive E2E Testing:** Established a full suite of end-to-end tests using Playwright to cover all critical user flows, role-based access control, and multi-tenancy data isolation.
*   **Unit & Integration Test Setup:** Configured Jest and established a testing strategy for authenticated pages and components.

---

### Phase 2: Performance & Data Optimization (In Progress)

**Objective:** Enhance performance, improve user experience, and ensure the platform is scalable and maintainable.

*   **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Implement `React.lazy` for route-based and component-based code splitting, targeting heavy components like the Resume Builder and AI Mock Interview UI.
*   **Image Optimization:** Convert all `<img>` tags to use the `next/image` component for automatic optimization and faster load times.
*   **Client-Side Data Caching:** Integrate `TanStack/React-Query` for client-side data fetching that requires caching and state management, especially for the Community Feed and Job Board.
*   **Static Generation (SSG & ISR):** Convert semi-static pages like `/blog` and `/resume-templates` to use SSG or ISR for near-instant load times.

### Phase 3: Advanced Feature Development (Upcoming)

**Objective:** Build a next-generation, intuitive resume editing experience.

*   **Full-Screen Resume Template Designer:**
    *   **Action:** Develop a full-screen, drag-and-drop resume editor at `/admin/template-designer/[templateId]`.
    *   **Core Interactions:**
        *   Implement drag-and-drop for reordering resume sections (e.g., Experience, Education).
        *   Enable inline, WYSIWYG text editing directly on the resume preview.
    *   **Styling Controls:** Add a "Property Inspector" panel to control font family, size, color, and text alignment for selected elements.
    *   **Dynamic Structure:** Allow users to add new custom sections and switch between single and two-column layouts.

*(For more detail, see `src/TEMPLATE-DESIGNER-ROADMAP.md`)*

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Establish a system for continuous performance monitoring and improvement.

*   **Implement Analytics:** Integrate a tool like Vercel Analytics or Sentry to track Core Web Vitals and identify performance bottlenecks in a real-world environment.
*   **Regular Audits:** Schedule quarterly performance and bundle size audits to proactively address regressions.
